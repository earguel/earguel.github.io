This is page describes my Fall 2021 Semester Project for AIT 722, Geo-Social, Data Analytics class at George Mason University (GMU). 
This project exploits exploratory and explanatory analysis of specific socio-economic and Temporal variables 
(i.e. college degree, blue collar worker, etc.) which correlated with Republican votes in the 2016 Presidential Election. 
Further Geographic Weighted Regression (GWR) analysis will be performed with new variables (vaccination rates &amp; CDS SVI index) 
to predict the Democratic vote in the upcoming 2024 US Presidential election.
