<h1 style="font-size:40px;">Exploratory Regression Methods</h1>
<br>
We will be examining broad spatial correlations at a national level to find properly specified regression models.  We will apply exploratory Regression to run Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
regression for every combination of candidate explanatory variable, up to the max number of variables specified to include in the model. 

Explanatory variables are ones with high positive or negative correlations as predictors of the dependent variable.  We will use this method to analyze the 2016 election results, specifically to predict the percentage of Trump votes.  We will then add additional 
explanatory variables (Vaccination Rates and CDC SVI Index) to explore the relationships that these control variables may have on the Democratic votes (dependent variable) in the upcoming 2024 US Presidential Election.

<h1 style="font-size:20px;">Identify battleground counties</h1>
<br>
Since the chances of finding a properly specified model increase with more explanatory variables  Let's now focus our analysis on identifying the battleground counties.  We will now add a calculated field (pGOP_minus_pDEM) using the 2016
 presidential vote percentages (Republican and Democratic).  We added this new explanatory variables to the counties layer, plus several distance variables to perform spatial analysis and visualize the underlying trends at the county 
 level which are associated with Trump votes in the 2016 election. This new calculated field variable is simply the difference between the percentage of Republican votes minus the percentage of Democratic votes.  Below is an embedded 
 map filtered to show only the counties where either Trump or Clinton won with less then 20% of the vote.

<h1 style="font-size:20px;">Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR): Percent Blue Collar Workers</h1>

We will now use Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) at the US county level to visualize the correlation between the percentage of votes for Trump and the percentage of blue collar workers.

<h1 style="font-size:20px;">CDC Vulnerability Index (SVI)</h1>
<br>
The degree to which a community exhibits certain social conditions, such as high poverty, low percentage access to a vehicle, or crowded housholds may negatively affect a community's ability
to respond to natural disasters.  The SVI index was developed by the CDC, Geospatial research, analysis & services program (GRASP) to help public officials and emergency response planners identify and 
map the communities that are most likely to need support prior to, during, and after a natural disaster.  SVI indicates the relative vulnerability of a community and groups them into four related themes.  Ea
track receives a ranking from 0 (least vulnerable) to 16 (most vulnerable).
